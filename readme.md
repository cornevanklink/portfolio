### Portfolio page
- [ ] Media query: My portfolio should have at least one media query.
- [ ] Change look of links


###  Technical Documentation Page
- [ ] Media query: Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
- [ ] Navbar: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
  - [ ] The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
  - [ ] Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
  - [ ] The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
  - [ ] Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
  - [ ] When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
  - [ ] On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
- [ ] Main element: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
- [ ] Sections: 
  - [ ] Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
  - [ ] The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
  - [ ] The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
  - [ ] The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
  - [ ] The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

### Product Landing Page
- [ ] Header 
  - [ ] Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar". The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
  - [ ] I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
  - [ ] Header Image: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
- [ ] Media query: My product landing page should have at least one media query.
- [ ] Embedded video: I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
- [ ] Form: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
  - [ ] Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
  - [ ]  The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
  - [ ]  The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
  - [ ]  Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
  - [ ]  When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
- [ ]  CSS flexbox
  - [ ]  My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
